<h1>The Best Movies According to Josie</h1>
<h2>My top movies of all time in no specific order</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Becoming Jane</h3>
<p>I love historical fiction and the acting in this movie makes it timeless to me.</p>

<h3>Slumdog Millionaire</h3>
<p>This movie pulls at my heartstrings and makes me feel so much. I still know the dance to Jai Ho:)</p>

<h3>Peanut Butter Falcon</h3>
<p>This movie is so heart-warming and was written/produced(?) by the same people who made Little Miss Sunshine - another favorite of mine.</p>

<h3>The Fall Guy</h3>
<p>I've watched this movie three times since it came out a few months ago and would happily watch it again. It's witty, cute, exciting, gives you a thrill, makes you care, and shines light on an interesting subject. The acting is amazing, which doesn't suprise me based on the cast.</p>

<h3>Disturbia</h3>
<p>I can't have a favorite movies of all time list and not put this one on here. It wouldn't be fair to all the friends i've made watch it with me since Junior High.</p>

<h3>How to lose a guy in 10 days</h3>
<p>I am a big fan of Kate Hudson and Matthew McConoghey rom-coms. They just go together.</p>
